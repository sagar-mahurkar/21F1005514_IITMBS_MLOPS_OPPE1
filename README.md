- Data comprises opening price, highest price, closing price, traded volume for a stock at every minute in the period from 2018 to 2021.
- Prioritise Building the MLOps pipeline, don’t spend much time in modelling efficiency

## Instructions

- AARTIIND
- ABCAPITAL

For the second iteration of the model (v1), add StockAnalyticaData/v1 data to StockAnalyticaData/v0 -  the data from v1 data folder comprising of these stocks:
- ABFRL
- ADANIENT
- ADANIGAS
